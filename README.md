  Koala JS keeps it simple. Say goodbye to the complexity of TypeScript and enjoy plain old JavaScript, making it perfect for developers who want to move fast without the overhead.

  Avoid the nightmare of dealing with null and undefined values. Koala JS provides built-in null safety features that keep your app stable and avoid those pesky runtime errors.

- **UI-Centric Design**  
  Focus on building great user interfaces without unnecessary complexity. Koala JS helps you keep your UI logic clear and easy to manage.

- **No Routing (Your Way)**  
  Freedom! Koala JS doesn't dictate how routing works in your app. You can easily integrate any routing solution that fits your needs, so you’re not locked into a rigid structure.

- **Small and Lightweight**  
  Koala JS is designed to be as small as possible so your application stays lean. No bloat, just the essentials!

- **State Management**  
  Koala JS comes with a simple and intuitive null-safe state management system. Managing your app’s state has never been so easy, and it won’t give you a headache. 💆‍♂️💆‍♀️

- **Built with Vite**  
  Lightning-fast builds, hot module reloading, and modern tooling—Koala JS is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), so you get top-tier development performance right out of the box.
